# Getting Started

This is the getting started guide for our documentation. This page will help you understand the basics of our platform.

## Introduction

Welcome to our documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to know about our product.

### Who is this for?

This documentation is designed for developers, designers, and product managers who want to learn how to use our platform effectively.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the implementation details, it's important to understand some key concepts:

1. **Projects** - A project is a container for all your work
2. **Components** - Reusable building blocks
3. **Pages** - Where you assemble components into full interfaces

### Projects Structure

Projects are organized in a hierarchy that makes it easy to manage complex systems:

- Project Root
  - Components
  - Pages
  - Assets
  - API

## Next Steps
