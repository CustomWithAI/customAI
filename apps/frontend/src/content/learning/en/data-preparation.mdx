> AI model development consists of three essential steps as follows:

## 1. Data Preparation

This step is the foundation of building an effective AI model.  
Proper data preparation ensures that the model can learn and perform correctly.

<Callout variant="info">
One of the most critical steps in AI model development is data preparation.  
Since data serves as the source from which the model learns,  
if the data preparation is inadequate, the model's performance will degrade.

## 2. Model Training

In this step, the model is trained using the prepared data,  
enabling it to learn patterns and relationships within the data.

## 3. Model Evaluation

After training, the model is tested and evaluated to measure its performance and accuracy in action.

## Types of Models for Image Tasks

When building AI models related to images, they can be categorized into two main types:

### 1. Image Classification

This involves identifying the category or class of an image, for example, classifying images of animals as either dogs or cats.

### 2. Object Detection & Segmentation

This involves identifying and locating objects within an image, as well as segmenting those objects.

## Annotating Data

For these tasks, it is essential to annotate the data,  
to specify the type and characteristics of the data accurately, ensuring that the model can learn effectively.

Annotations should be as accurate and close to reality as possible, for example:

- In image classification, the exact category of the image should be specified.
- In object detection or segmentation tasks, objects should be accurately bounded, without missing or overextending any part.

High-quality data preparation and accurate annotation are crucial factors  
that directly affect the success of an AI model.
